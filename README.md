# Audio_Manipulation

This project aims to provide a solution for dubbing English videos into the Amharic language. The system takes an English video, transcribes the audio, saves the transcriptions for later use, translates the transcriptions from English to Amharic, and finally generates an Amharic audio using text-to-speech technology. This allows for the creation of Amharic-dubbed versions of videos.

## Introduction

Dubbing videos into different languages is a complex and time-consuming process. The above code performs the transcription, translation, and generation of Amharic audio for English videos. By using speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech technologies, this system enables the creation of Amharic-dubbed versions of videos.

## Features

- Video transcription from English to text
- Translation of transcriptions from English to Amharic
- Generation of Amharic audio using text-to-speech technology
- User-friendly interface for easy video processing and dubbing
